This is a Python Tkinter based Flash Card app which uses Pandas.
It randomly takes out frequently used french words from the .csv file and shows its English translation user can select if he knows the correct answer or not
if he don't then it saves it to the new csv file to make sure that words does repeat.
I developed this to learn french :) but you can modify to learn any other language or anything you want.

In further updates I want to add a functionality so that user can upload his csv files without digging its source code ( You are welcome for any creativity or bug fixing :)
