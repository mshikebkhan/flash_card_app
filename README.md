This is a Python Tkinter based Flash Card app that uses Pandas.
It randomly takes out frequently used french words from the .csv file and shows its English translation user can select if he knows the correct answer or not
if he don't then it saves it to the new csv file to make sure that words does repeat.
I developed this to learn French :) but you can modify it to learn any other language or anything you want.

In further updates, I want to add functionality so that the user can upload his CSV files without digging into its source code ( You are welcome for any creativity or bug fixing :)


Note: Please install pandas before you run it.
